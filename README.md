After several weeks I've managed to start building a landing page concerning the Sharing is Caring Project.

My project is about children studies in India and how Important is to overcome some of the problems that are currently going on there.

I'll tell a story of a boy together with India Facts, so that it can have a better impact and communication with the audience.
